<h1>Pixel Theme</h1>
        <p>This website uses the Pixel Theme provided for free by Aigars Silkalns. However, the source code of the template
            as on July 2018 had numerous errors which would occasionally (and almost randomly) not display the big post title
            and image. There were also some error in the JQuery code used to format date and time. These problems still persist
            in this implementation of the template, but I have tried my best to reduce their frequency.</p>

        <p>The Blogger theme with my changes is available on
            <a href="https://github.com/utsavm9/blogger/blob/master/theme.xml">GitHub</a>. When coding with my theme, the following CSS classes are to be kept in mind: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    <code>.myBlock</code>
                </strong>: Encapsulates all the important content of a post in a darker background. The list items within
                this class will be spaces appropriately.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    <code>.letter</code>
                </strong>: Similar to
                <code>.myBlock</code>, but includes extra line spacing for paragraphs to highlight the leaving of lines in a letter</li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    <code>.myName</code>
                </strong>: Right-aligns and italicizes text. Useful for writing the name at the end of a literary prose.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    <code>.handwriting</code>
                </strong>: Uses Sacramento font to give the effect of a signature</li>
        </ul>


        <br/>
        <p>I also made the following changes because I felt that they made the errors and rendering the website appear less
            often:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Made the navigation
                <code>display: block !important</code>
            </li>
            <li>Increased the size of the header logo</li>
            <li>Made table header backgrounds darker</li>
            <li>Made the table border black.</li>
            <li>Removed the pixel advertisement block on the template using CSS because the option to do so was unavailable in
                the layout menu of Blogger.</li>
        </ul>
    <br />
